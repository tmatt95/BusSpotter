        <h2>The Problems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>Lots of information is never written down</h5>
                <p>There are very interesting bus stories spread through word of
                    mouth which never get written down. It would be a shame to 
                    loose these. Through commenting on the vehicles we will be 
                    able to create an archive of these and hopefully there never
                    loose them.

        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>A place where people can record their bus stories</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>A fun way of recording bus spottings</h5>
                <p>To create a system which allows people to record information
                     on the buses they see when they see them. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Documenting the vehicles interesting histories</h5>
